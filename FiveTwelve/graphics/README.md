# graphics

Graphics infrastructure, fork of Zelle's graphics.py

Initially this contains just a copy of Zelle's graphics.py.
Starting point is graphics.py
version 5.0, forked December 2017.

As Zelle's module is open-sourced as GPL, adopted GPL for this
repo.

Putting this in a subdirectory of a student project, graphics can be
imported with

```
import graphics.grapics as graphics
```
